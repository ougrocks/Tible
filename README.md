TIME TABLE GENERATOR - Automation. Final Year Project for Inderprastha Engineering College.

Timetable scheduling has been in human requirements since they thought
of managing time effectively. It is widely used in schools, colleges and
other fields of teaching and working like crash courses, coaching centres,
training programs etc. In early days, timetable scheduling was done
manually with a single person or some group involved in the task of scheduling
it, which takes a lot of effort and time. While scheduling even the smallest
constraints can take a lot of time and the case is even worse when the
number of constraints or the amount of data to deal with increases. In such
cases perfectly designed timetable is reused for the whole generation without
any changes, proving to be dull in such situations. Other cases that can
cause a problem is when the number of employers/workers are weak,
resulting in a rescheduling of timetable or they need to fill on empty seats
urgently.

Institutions/Schools/Colleges/Universities are the regular users of such
timetables. They need to schedule their course to meet the need of current
duration and facilities that are available to them. However, their schedule
should meet the requirements of new course addition and newly enrolled
students in fresh batches. This may result in rescheduling the entire timetable
once again for its entire batches and to be scheduled in shortest
possible time before the batches course start. Another problem that occurs
is when scheduling timetable for exams. When multiple batches have exam
on the same day, they need to be scheduled effectively taking into account
all problems related to facilities that are available to conduct these exams
simultaneously.
